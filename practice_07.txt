#Assignment 02
#1 Using the built-in R data set nhtemp
#(a)Briefly describe the data set.
str(nhtemp)
head(nhtemp)

#(b)Create a histogram of the data set with the following criteria.
#i.using class intervals of 1 from 44 to 58
#ii. class intervals should be left-close and right-open
#iii. add a meaningful main title and x-axis label to the plot
#iv. on top of each rectangle, label the number of data count in that class interval
#v. each bar of the histogram should be of the colour ¡§#B4EEB4¡¨ except the tallest bar be of the colour ¡§#698B69¡¨
breakpts <- seq(46, 56, by = 1) 

ncolours <- length(breakpts) - 1
bincolours <- vector(mode="character", length = ncolours)
bincolours[1:ncolours] <- "#B4EEB4"
bincolours
a <- hist(nhtemp,
          breaks = breakpts,
          right = FALSE
)
bincolours[a$counts == max(a$counts)] <- "#698B69"
bincolours

hist(nhtemp,
     breaks = breakpts,        # using breaks in 'breakpts'
     right = FALSE,            # create a histogram on left close and right open intervals
     labels = TRUE,
     xlab = "temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit",   # x-axis label
     main = "Average annual temperature in degrees\n Fahrenheit in New Haven, Connecticut, from 1912 to 1971",
     col = bincolours
)

#2 Using the built-in R data set pressure
#(a)Plot the variables pressure on temperature, and use the following command to pass a curve through these data:
  curve((0.168 + 0.007*x)^(20/3),
        from = 0,
        to = 400,
        add = TRUE
  )
#(b)Apply the power transformation y
#   3/20 to the pressure data values. Plot these
#   transformed values against temperature. Is a linear or nonlinear relationship
#   evident now? Use the abline() function to pass a straight line through the
#   points. (You need an intercept and slope for this see the previous part of this
#   question to obtain appropriate values.)
#(c)Add a suitable title to the graph.
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(pressure ~ temperature,
     data=pressure
)
curve((0.168 + 0.007*x)^(20/3),
      from = 0,
      to = 400,
      add = TRUE
)

y <- (pressure$pressure)^(3/20)
plot(y ~ pressure$temperature,
     main = "some meaningful title here",
     xlab = "temperature",
     ylab = "pressure^(3/20)"
)
curve((0.168 + 0.007*x),
      from = 0,
      to = 400,
      add = TRUE
)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
